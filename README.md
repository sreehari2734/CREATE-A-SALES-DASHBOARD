Overview: This repository contains the projects completed as part of my Power BI internship at CodtechIT Solutions. The internship focused on using Power BI for business intelligence tasks such as data visualization, dashboard creation, and performance analysis. Throughout these tasks, I applied Power BI's features for data analysis and reporting to drive actionable insights.

Projects Completed Task 1: Sales Performance Dashboard Objective: The goal of this task was to create a comprehensive Sales Performance Dashboard to analyze the performance of furniture sales. The dashboard was designed to visualize key sales metrics, identify trends, and track performance across different regions and categories. It aimed to provide actionable insights for decision-making and strategy improvement.

Tools & Techniques: Power BI: Used for data visualization, dashboard creation, and performance analysis. Power Query: Cleaned and transformed the sales dataset before importing it into Power BI. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized to create custom calculations such as Total Sales, Profit Margins, etc. Visualizations: Implemented bar charts, line graphs, slicers, and KPI indicators to show sales trends, category performance, and regional distribution. Data Sources: Furniture Sales Analysis Dataset from Kaggle

Task 2: Human Resources Analysis Objective: The goal of this task was to analyze the human resources dataset to uncover insights related to employee attrition, performance, and key factors influencing employee retention. The analysis aimed to understand patterns and correlations between different employee attributes, such as job satisfaction, performance ratings, and work-life balance, to help HR teams optimize retention strategies and improve employee engagement.
